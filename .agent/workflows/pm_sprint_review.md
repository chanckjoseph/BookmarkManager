# PM Workflow: Sprint Review & Strategy

1. **Audit Deliverables**
   - Read `task.md` to see what was completed (`[x]`).
   - Read `test_report.md` (generated by QA) to verify quality.
   - Read `walkthrough.md` to understand the User Experience changes.

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare "Delivered" vs "Promised" (in `sprint_[XX]_plan.md`).
   - Identify any de-scoped items or "Technical Debt" incurred.

3. **Write Strategic Review**
   - Create or update `pm_review.md`.
   - Section: **Executive Summary** (Pass/Fail).
   - Section: **Deliverables Status** (Table).
   - Section: **Strategic Decisions** (Why was X removed? Why did we add Y?).
   - Section: **Next Steps** (Recommendations for next Sprint).

4. **Approval**
   - If satisfied, "Approve" the release in the notification.
   - If not, request specific "Hotfixes" via `task.md`.
